The fish has bright blue and yellow scales with a small, distinctive orange spot on its side, its fins moving fluidly. The coral reefs are alive with a variety of marine life, including small schools of colorful fish and sea turtles gliding by. The water is crystal clear, allowing for a view of the sandy ocean floor below. The reef itself is adorned with a mix of hard and soft corals in shades of red, orange, and green. The photo captures the fish from a slightly elevated angle, emphasizing its lively movements and the vivid colors of its surroundings. A close-up shot with dynamic movement." \
